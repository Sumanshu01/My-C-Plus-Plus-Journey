Fixed Size (Arrays) vs. Dynamic Size (Vectors)
Arrays:
Fixed size at compile time (for static arrays) or runtime (for dynamic arrays)
Stored in contiguous memory
No built-in bounds checking
Cannot be resized after creation
Don't know their own size (size must be tracked separately)

Vectors:
Dynamic size that can grow and shrink at runtime
Stored in contiguous memory
Provides bounds checking
Can be resized using functions like push_back(), pop_back()
Knows its own size (accessible via size() method)
Automatically manages memory allocation/deallocation
Part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
